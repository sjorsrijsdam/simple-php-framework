# Simple PHP framework
This is a very simple PHP web framework that I created to show how a framework with a frictionless dependency injection container could work. It is not meant to be used in production, but it can be used as a learning tool.

## Requirements
- PHP 8.1 or higher (`sudo apt install php8.1-cli`)
- libsqlite3 (`sudo apt install php8.1-sqlite3`)

## Usage
 - Run `start.sh`
 - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
